# Computational Intelligence Lab 
This is the repository of the *MassiveGainz* team containing the code and paper for the 2015 computational intelligence lab course at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

## Paper
The paper can be found in LaTeX format in the `cil-report` folder. 

## Running experiments
Clone this repository, browse to the inpainting folder in matlab and run `experiments`. This will run the experiments that are defined in the `experiments.m` file. For the full data set this will take a long time.

## Creating plots and figures
After the experiments have finished, you can turn the results into plots and figures that were used in the report. Run `illustrations` to generate figure 2 and figure 3 from the report. Run `plots` from the results folder to generate the other plots.
