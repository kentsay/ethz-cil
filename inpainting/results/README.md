# Plotting

This folder contains the results from our experiments and a script for generating the plots. We mainly focus on plotting two metrics: Mean squared error and runtime in seconds. The script generates two figures:

1. Mean squared error with random masks as a line plot with a log scale for the y-axis.
2. Runtime with random masks as a line plot with a log scale for the y-axis.

The script is divided into three parts: load data from file, plot the mean squared error and plot the runtime. If you want to reproduce the plots, execute the `plots.m` script.
